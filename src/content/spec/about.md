# About
# Hi, I'm Sheetal Naik — nice to meet you 👋

I’m a frontend developer with 3+ years of experience building sleek, scalable, and intuitive web applications.
I work with the fundamentals — **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — and I enjoy using tools like **React and Redux** to bring ideas to life. Recently, I’ve also started exploring **TypeScript and Next.js**, slowly leveling up my tech stack.
My journey into frontend was accidental. I happened to work on it in my first job — and somewhere between figuring things out, breaking things, and shipping projects, I realized I genuinely loved it.
Even though I had learned Java and C++ earlier, frontend felt different. It blended logic with creativity, design with problem-solving, and code with real people’s needs. Understanding the human side of the web — **UX, clarity, and empathy** — is what keeps me excited about building.

Outside of work, I dabble on occasional **side projects** and you might spot me reading in a café, at the movies with popcorn, or button-smashing at an arcade.

## How I create Impact
- building things that are clear, accessible, and usable
- sharing what I learn so others can move faster
- staying curious, experimenting, and always leveling up
