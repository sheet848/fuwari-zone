# About
# Hi, I'm Sheetal Naik. Nice to Meet You

I’m a frontend developer with 3+ years of experience building sleek, scalable, and intuitive web applications.

I work with the fundamentals: **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**; and I enjoy using tools like **React and Redux** to bring ideas to life. Recently, I’ve also started exploring **TypeScript and Next.js**, slowly leveling up my tech stack.

My journey into frontend was accidental. I happened to work on it in my first job — and somewhere between figuring things out, breaking things, and shipping projects, I realized I genuinely loved it.
Even though I had learned Java and C++ earlier, I found myself getting into my role seamlessly. The blend of logic with creativity, design with problem-solving, and code with real people’s needs. Understanding the **human side of the web** and also the **business side of the industry** is what keeps me excited about building.

Outside of work, I dabble on occasional **side projects** and you might spot me reading in a café, at the movies with popcorn, or button-smashing at an arcade.

> ## How I create Impact
> - building things that are **clear**, **accessible**, and **usable**
> - **sharing** what I learn so others can move faster
> - staying **curious**, **experimenting**, and always **leveling up**
